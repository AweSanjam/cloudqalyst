# 🌩️ CloudQALyst(WIP)

**CloudQALyst** is a local-first QA and support test dashboard that runs automated tests, logs the results, and serves them via a simple web UI. It’s designed to be cloud-deployable later (AWS/GCP ready), but keeps things light and free to run locally.

> 🔧 Built for aspiring QA engineers, support techs, and cloud-curious devs.
